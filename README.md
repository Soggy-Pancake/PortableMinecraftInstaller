This a quick python program that will set up a java install with multimc cracked with a batch file to run multimc without any annoying popups

Downloads UltimMC (Just cracked multimc https://github.com/UltimMC/Launcher) and sets up java19 in ./java

after downloading java and UltimMC it sets up the config file so the correct java is selected and changes the hostname in ultimmc.cfg (If it doesn't match ultimmc asks for java location again) and launches it like you would expect
